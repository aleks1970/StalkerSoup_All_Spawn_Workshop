		<text>So, Senior Fellow, the latest recommendations:\n On a platform above the brain should be a couple modifiers. For us - a dummy and of no interest. Further, or in conjunction with this, to be activated teleporter. Look down, along the supply cables. You'll have to jump off the platform on the cable to the teleporter. I advise you to wear all the protection you have. Next. Do not rush to the teleporter, and after passing through a cable midway, turn to tank with the brain and destroy at the time of self-healing protective field of the Brain. The right weapon you have. Then you can go to the teleporter. Destroy the shield is essential to use the teleporter. Otherwise, you will die. Two modifiers should be in your backpack. You will get to the very brain. There should be a transformation in modifiers necessary for us to break the psy-ray influence of the Brain. Further activates the teleport to take you back to the surface. '</text>

		<text>We'll need to raise the morale of the Stalkers engaged in the operation. We need to find the Stalkers, the leading surveillance camp of bandits and place them at the right moment to commit robbery at the camp. Probably will not profit as much as, but we need to bring them twenty cans of food, ten medkits, five bottles of vodka, ten packs of 5.45x39 armor-piercing, and two short Kalashnikovs - the AKS 74U will be fine. Okay? You should be able to find most of these at the bandit camp, but if not then look elsewhere for them. Then you have to gather and bring the survivors of Stalkers to their guests.</text>

Perfumer was able to negotiate with the chief security officer by the name Duda... It is located in a house with columns, which is near the area. The Doc is obviously held somewhere. If you have enough money to pay ransom, and finish the job 'peaceful' way. The Doc is released and he gets to the house of Perfumer. After it will be possible to arrange a showdown with the very group that if you disable protection center.\n The second option is also available. If money for the ransom is not enough, you can try to force release of the Doctor.
